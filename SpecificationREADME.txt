Specification README

The README should have these sections:

    A description of the problem your project addresses.  This can be a 1 paragraph 
    description, mentioning the overall topic and why it's important.

   

		Software packages and tools are becoming increasingly more ubiquitous and 
    more complex. In todayâ€™s context of widespread software vulnerabilities, 
    keeping any machine environment to up date is essential for any user or admin. 
    When there is a large number of machines, we often times want to be able to 
    monitor and alter software package versions on these machines easily.

   



    A description of how your project addresses that problem.   
    This should typically be 2-5 pages, depending on the project.  Provide the 
    architecture of your project: what are the components including UNIX services 
    and custom software you wrote, how do they interact with each other, using 
    what protocols?  Provide a description of the features of your project: what 
    does it do and what can it be used for?  If the project involves user input, 
    describe how the users would interact with it in order to use the features.  
    If the project involved testing and analyzing results, provide those results 
    in a clearly understandable format.
