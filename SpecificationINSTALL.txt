Specification: INSTALL

The INSTALL should provide instructions on how to set up an environment for your project from scratch.  
At a minumum, it should include:

    1. A description of what OS(es) to use and which package(s) to install, how. 
    For example, yum install <list of packages>
	
		OS:
			CentOS 6.x minimal install
		List of packages to be installed on master server machine:
			yum -y install nmap
			yum -y install httpd
			yum -y install perl
			yum -y install openssh-clients
			yum -y install openssh-server
			yum -y install gcc 
			yum -y install php-devel 
			yum -y install php-pear 
			yum -y install libssh2 
			yum -y install libssh2-devel 
			yum -y install make
			
		List of packages to be installed on client machines:
			yum -y install nmap
			yum -y install perl
			yum -y install openssh-clients
			yum -y install openssh-server
	

    2. A description of any configuration file modifications that need to be made 
    for the project to operate properly. 
		
		1.Modify html configuration file as appropriate
			sed -i "s/#ServerName www.example.com:80/#ServerName www.example.com:80\n\nServerName localhost:80/g" /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

    3. A list of any commands that need to be run in order to make the project work.  
    For example, generating SSH keys for remote computer access.
		
		
		1.Install ssh2 extension for php
			yes '' | pecl install -f ssh2
			touch /etc/php.d/ssh2.ini
			echo extension=ssh2.so > /etc/php.d/ssh2.ini
		
		
		
		
		2.Need to generate ssh keys for the authentication between client and host machines:
	
			Create SSH directory and set permissions
				mkdir ~/.ssh
				chmod 700 ~/.ssh
			
			ssh-keygen -q -f "$host_id" -N ""
			mv ./$host_id ~/.ssh
			mv ./$host_id.pub ~/.ssh
			
			
			
			
		3.Start apache and configure to run automatically at boot
			service httpd start
			chkconfig httpd on
	
			


    4. If there are any further steps (for example, either downloading or compiling 
	code, or setting up a user to access the administrative webpage for the project), 
	a description of those steps.
	
		
		1.Make the necessary directories to store logs, scripts and such
			mkdir /var/www/html/sccm
			cp -a ./host/program_files/* /var/www/html/sccm
			chmod -R 777 /var/www/html/sccm	
		
		2.Add host machine IP and hostname to required areas in client scripts
			sed -i "s/GENERATED_HOST_IP/$host_ip/g" ./host/client_gen/client_install.sh
			sed -i "s/GENERATED_HOST_ID/$host_id/g" ./host/client_gen/client_install.sh
			sed -i "s/GENERATED_HOST_ID/$host_id/g" ./host/client_gen/client/program_files/*
	
		
	
    5. A description of how the user who set up the project will know that it's 
    working correctly.
		
		Upon refreshing the web dashboard on the server you should see your new 
	client machine and be able to see packages that needs updating.
