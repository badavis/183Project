Specification: INSTALL

The INSTALL should provide instructions on how to set up an environment for your project from scratch.  
At a minumum, it should include:

    1. A description of what OS(es) to use and which package(s) to install, how. 
    For example, yum install <list of packages>
	
	OS:
		CentOS 6.x minimal install
	List of packages:
		yum -y install nmap
		yum -y install httpd
		yum -y install perl
		yum -y install openssh-clients
		yum -y install openssh-server
		yum -y install gcc 
		yum -y install php-devel 
		yum -y install php-pear 
		yum -y install libssh2 
		yum -y install libssh2-devel 
		yum -y install make
	

    2. A description of any configuration file modifications that need to be made 
    for the project to operate properly. 

		None.

    3. A list of any commands that need to be run in order to make the project work.  
    For example, generating SSH keys for remote computer access.
    
		We need to generate ssh keys for the authentication between client and host machines 
	in the update scripts:
		ssh-keygen -q -f "$host_id" -N ""
		mv ./$host_id ~/.ssh
		mv ./$host_id.pub ~/.ssh


    4. If there are any further steps (for example, either downloading or compiling 
	code, or setting up a user to access the administrative webpage for the project), 
	a description of those steps.
	
		
	
    5. A description of how the user who set up the project will know that it's 
    working correctly.
		
		Upon refreshing the web dashboard on the server you should see your new 
	client machine and be able to see packages that needs updating.
